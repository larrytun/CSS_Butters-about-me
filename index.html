        <p>Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?<br>
        Turn a frown into a smile for free?<br>
        Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?<br>
        Everyone knows it's Butters!<br>
        Butters: "That's me!"<br>
        Who's the boy with eyes full of wonder?<br>
        Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?<br>
        Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?<br>
        Everyone knows it's Butters!<br>
        Butters: "That's me!"<br>
        Jumping in puddles, skipping down the hallway.<br>
        Petting goats at the petting zoo, he loves John Elway.<br>
        Butters: "No way!"<br>
        Who's the little tyke with the cutest little dimples?<br>
        Batting his eyes at every puppy he sees?<br>
        If you look inside yourself you might be surprised when you find<br>
        A little boy named Butters!<br>
        Butters: "Well that's - That's me! Yeah."</p>
